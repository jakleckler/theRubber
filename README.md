OKAY
things you will need

-A good tool that I like to use for development is Sublime Text 3.  It's dope, try it out.

-READ https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md
---this is the style guide that I am basing my code off of.

-xampp - for the database for now.  If you don't have it, download it, or something similar
---In xampp, clone the git repo into the htdocs folder which is in the xampp folder.

	cd xampp/htdocs
	git clone https://github.com/jakleckler/therubber.git
	cd therubber

-- I am trying to get better at subversion, and using branches. I am going to do most of my coding on the develop branch, and merge it over to the main branch as necessary

	git checkout develop

I have created a very simple users table in xampp, but don't know how to share that with you, we can get into that more as it comes.  No rush, this is just here for reference.
